check_tcptraffic is a Nagios plugin to monitor the amount of TCP traffic

Usage check_tcptraffic [-v] [-r] -c crit -w warn -i iface

  -c crit      critical
  -w warn      warning
  -i iface     network interface
  -r           initialize
  -v           verbose

check_tcptraffic uses the /proc/net/dev Linux entry to compute the
amount of transferred bytes from the last plugin execution (temporary
data is stored in the /tmp/check_tcptraffic-iface file)

Since /proc/net/dev uses 32bit counters overflows are a problem
(especially on a fast interface)
